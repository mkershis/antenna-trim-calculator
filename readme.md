## Dipole Antenna Tuning Calculator

This calculator uses the well-known formula:

$$L = \frac{468}{f}$$


for calculating the length (L, in feet) of a half-wave dipole antenna at a given frequency (f, in MHz). If you know what frequency you are aiming for, and have a measurement of where the antenna is currently resonant, you can use this equation to calculate the amount of wire you need to add or remove:

$$\Delta L = \left|\frac{468}{f_{current}}-\frac{468}{f_{desired}}\right|$$

Simply enter these two frequencies and hit "Run calculation". You can choose between imperial and metric units, and can also specify the precision for the imperial units to the closest $\frac{1}{32}''$ or $\frac{1}{16}''$ since you'll most likely be using a ruler or tape measure while tuning your antenna in the field.
